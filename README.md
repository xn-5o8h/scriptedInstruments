An attempt at making a lua-driven instrument that could be played via
- MML
- abc
- aiming the instrument up and down (hi duck game)
- arbitrary sound (cat piano?!)

Still WIP
- only the mml reader works ( using https://github.com/mirrexagon/lua-mml )
- pitch mapping seems to be okay
- notes don't seem to be the right height
- it's slow!!!!!!

- Twinkle twinkle little star comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65tWX0BsAwA
- All notes using a vanilla instrument: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QDQ4eotdBY
- All notes using this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUxa2gB_dF0

I don't wanna put more time into it because the timing issue seems unsolvable (artificially increase the tempo?), i'm too unknowledged to get why notes aren't correct, and I have other projects in mind, but feel free to reuse or whatever (actually I don't know how the licencing of a smaller piece of code in a bigger thing works but check mml.lua's licence)
